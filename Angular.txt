angular directive template hostlistner tooltipRef smoke test

1) What are directives in Angular?
Ans=> https://www.tatvasoft.com/outsourcing/2023/06/directives-in-angular.html

2) In a template how can be distinguish b/w Attribute and Structural Directive?

3) Is asterisk (*) mandatory to use before structural directive?
Ans=> No, the asterisk (*) is not strictly necessary for structural directives,
	but it is the shorthand "syntactic sugar" that makes them much easier to use.
	Behind the scenes, Angular expands the asterisk into a more verbose <ng-template> element.

	<ng-template [ngIf]="hero"> <div> {{hero.name}} </div> </ng-template>	
	<div *ngIf="hero"> {{hero.name}} </div>


4) Component is a directive explain?

5) Life Cycle Hooks? xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ans=> https://angular.dev/guide/components/lifecycle

7) ngOnit vs ngOnChanges. What is the differnce? Who is called first ngOnInit or ngOnChanges?
   When are input properties initialized?

8) What does constructor do in angular? A rule We should not write any business
   logic or initializer logic a contructor? Technically we can subcribe to something or
   do someting or trverse an api call in a constructor? But it is prohibited in companies Why?
   It can cause errors in the future? Logic is cpomponent is not always initialized when
   constructor is called. So that means ngOnDestoy would not be called.

9) AfterViewInit when it is called? ngOnDestry used to cancel subscription, what are the
   other ways manages subscription to achieve this? Async pipe. Third party libraries
   to make them wait bioler plating? Take Until it acquires. fromNgNeet and untilDisplay.Third Party Library

10) *ngFor structural directive has trackBy property. What is that? What does trackBy help with?
	https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/structural-directives.html#!#asterisk

11) Do you know about view encapsulation? Component decorator we have view encapsulation property. We can
	set it to none. Can you describe it?

12) What is shadow dom? Kinds of selectors in angular for css?

13) What is angular ng-deep? Is it similar to css important? Why should we not use it? 
	Use Host before ng deep if it is absolutely necessary to use.

14) What is change detection stratergy? What are all the stratergies? How it is done can you tell the
	entire process. What are the says to perform change detection? Run by Application ref t?? 
	Change detection on the whole tree.

15) What do you understand by lazy loading?

=>	It is a way to split up bundles into seperate smaller bundles and to optimize initial loading time
	only load what you need.

16) How dependency injection works in angular? What are Platform Module. What will happen if lazy loaded
	module in the parent will it be avaible to the childen through depency injection.

=> Dependency injection tree and angular can provide injectables on different levels and if dependency
	is provided on top level it is also accesbil down the line. It can be provoded on the application level or
	platform level. Module level and the components level which is acessible to the children.

17) Dependency injector lookup logic? How to restrict it? How to make it optional or Self. Can we send a
	error message on

=> In constructor.

18) How do angular components interact with each other? Including the built-in ways?

=> Input/Output
	Services => Can be injected on modular or component level. And all the child elements can access it and
	change values or subscribe to values changes.
	Manual Call=> Some methods like set value on component with like view child or content child.

19) Dependency Injection. What if we will write provided in root and the same Service in the provider section
	of some component? What will happen?

=> The component will create its own instance and it will replace the root injected one. And the children
	of that component, they will use the closed provided one.

20) Have you worked with ngrx? Can you tell the life cycle of lifecycle?

=> First action is dispatched then it goes through a reducer and then effect takes place which is depended
	on the action or the state change. And then effect may or not dispatched another action. That is then
	passed to the reducer again and so on.

21) When should we use state management libraries?

=> When we have a lot of inter connected entities, similar to why we use sql database over nosql database.
	When entities have a lot of relationships and a lot of complexities.

22) Difference between pure and impure pipe? In our template we have

=> Pure pipe only checks like the output value only runs when input changes. Impure pipe runs on every
	change detection cycle.

23) We have used a method in our template for some interpolation. Is it good or not? What do you think we
	can do Let's assume we do need to use a method what we can do knowing the method we are using is pure
	depends on some value, probably we are doing it with some ngFor or maybe like doing something directly
	in the HTML template and inyterplation but in some method. Is there a way to optimise the performance?

=> If we have to get some value we call an actual method of the component it is not good because Ideally
	we should precompute that value and store it in a variable because thid method would  run on every
	change detection cycle like whenever the component detects change.
	Yes we can if we somehow cache the output value of the method for example so if the inputs don't change,
	it doesn't recompute. Maybe some pattern or way. there is a common name for such a functions to 
	remember the input and output value. It is called memorize approach, so memorize pipes.

24) Can you describe rxJs and its realtion with angular.

=> rxJs is a pretty big library that provides us with various ways to handle asynchronous things or events
	so basically asynchronous stuff and so it provies us with various ways to modify the stream of data
	on the fly with pipeable operators we can use it for cacheing like to store data or to store the states
	of someting and to be able to react to the state changes.

25) What is inside rxJs. Like what are the main parrts of rxJS? What it provides.

=> First one is observables i.e the stream of data over time, the behvaviour subject like sujects doesn't
	store the value. Behvaviour subject does store the last value, there is replace objects that replay
	values whenever new subscription occurs like n values that we specify. And there is async subject.

26) What is an observable and and observer? What is hot and cold obervable?

=> Obseravble is a thinng that you can subscribe to and emits values and observer is something that
	subscribes to the observervable.
	Cold observable only emit on subcription and don't share value for mutiple subscribers like angular
	http methods.
	Hot observable are sharing the values and they don't really care about the subcriptions to them, they
	just emit the values and share same values across multiple subscribers. And they start even when some
	method is subscribed to them or not.

27) What will we recieve when we call i mean subecribe the same cold obervable twice.

=> Potentially we will recieve different value, we can recieve same also depends on condition.

28) Ho wcan we make cold obervable hot??

=> We can share it or share replay the last value. Like i like using share replay for cacheing values, if
	we don't need to refresh it to often, there is also publish. With publish we would use another one so
	as to actually start the emissions. Basically to initialize the emissions like we first publish and
	then call another method.

29) What are rxJs schedulars?
=> By default rxJs handles observables synchronously like in the main thread. So async schedulars does the
	same asynchronously.

30) Do we need to unsubscribe from each and every obervable or not?
=> The obervalbles that emit only one value are destroyed like http cold observable, they would just emit
	one value and then finalize themselves. So not all observables need to be subcribed. Some we may skip.
	I would probably always use ngOnDestoy just to ensure.

31) HTTP Clients. What are the benifits of using http clients? And why we are not using fetch or XHR
	request?
=>  Http client is build on top of xHttp request and not upon fetch like fetch is not monkey pouched by
	Zone.JS and the change detection doesn't run upon fetch, so angular HTTP client is wrapped with ng-Zone
	so is run with angular so we can ensure like proper change detection when stuff is recieved. and also
	it kind of emits observables which is kind of way to manage data with angular.

32) HTTP client feature to intercept them?

=> So we have interceptor with angular so we can intercept request or responses and like attach some
	custom headers or modify the data in some way to transfor. So this is allowed because we are using
	a single HTTP client, so this is run on top of http client.

33) What is the design pattern underneath the interceptor or how interceptor is implemented?
=> So its commly middleware.

34) What if we ahve multiple interceptors how will they interact? What if we introduced an interceptor but
	if we for some reason need to use the http client without it. What we can do with it.

=> They will run all of them in sequence but in which sequence I think depending on where we provide them
	from the closet to the most top level one.
	Maybe override the provider to use nothing instead of you use value or class on level where its
	provided.

35) What techniques have you used for optimization in angular?
=> Rendering optimization- I would use on push with different trackBy, have methods like caching of hard
	computations. For data caching I would use share replay. Or some store with split the bundle up into
	smaller bundles like with lazy loading. Probably make pwa to cache assets and then use service workers
	for cacheing assets.
